## Five New Research Ideas

### 1. Idea Title: AI-Guided Discovery of High-Entropy Solid Electrolytes
- **Rationale:** High-entropy materials have shown promise for enhanced ionic conductivity and stability, but the compositional space is vast and experimentally intractable. AI can accelerate the discovery of novel compositions with optimal properties.
- **Feasibility:** High. Datasets of known electrolytes exist. Generative models can propose new compositions, which can be screened using high-throughput DFT or machine-learned potentials for stability and ionic conductivity. Risks include model accuracy and synthesizability of predicted compounds.
- **Potential Impact:** Could lead to the discovery of a new class of solid electrolytes with unprecedented performance, stability, and processability, accelerating the development of all-solid-state batteries.

### 2. Idea Title: Atomistic Simulation of Pressure-Induced Degradation in Sulfide Electrolytes
- **Rationale:** While stack pressure improves conductivity, excessive pressure can induce detrimental phase transitions or dislocations that degrade long-term performance. The atomistic mechanisms are not well understood.
- **Feasibility:** High. Reactive force fields (ReaxFF) or machine-learned potentials can be used to simulate the effects of high pressure on the crystal structure of sulfide electrolytes like Li₇SiPS₈. The main challenge is the computational cost of large-scale, long-timescale simulations.
- **Potential Impact:** Establishing a fundamental understanding of pressure-induced failure will enable the rational design of more mechanically robust electrolytes and optimized cell assembly protocols.

### 3. Idea Title: Multiscale Modeling of Ion Transport in Polymer-Inorganic Composite Electrolytes
- **Rationale:** The synergistic enhancement of ionic conductivity in composite electrolytes is not fully understood. It is unclear how ions navigate the complex interface between the polymer matrix and the inorganic filler.
- **Feasibility:** Medium. This requires a multiscale approach: DFT to understand ion-filler interactions, classical MD to simulate transport across the polymer-filler interface, and finite element modeling to predict bulk conductivity from the microstructure. The primary risk is the complexity of accurately coupling these different scales.
- **Potential Impact:** This research would provide design rules for creating composite electrolytes with maximized ionic conductivity by engineering the chemistry and morphology of the polymer-filler interface.

### 4. Idea Title: In-Silico Design of Self-Healing Solid Electrolyte Interphases (SEI)
- **Rationale:** A major failure mode in solid-state batteries is the formation of cracks at the electrode-electrolyte interface. An SEI that can autonomously heal these cracks would dramatically improve cycle life.
- **Feasibility:** Medium. High-throughput DFT can be used to screen for materials that are both electrochemically stable and have low shear moduli (indicative of ductility). Molecular dynamics can then be used to simulate the healing process at a crack tip. The risk is finding a material that satisfies all competing requirements (stability, ductility, ionic conductivity).
- **Potential Impact:** A breakthrough in interfacial engineering, leading to solid-state batteries with significantly longer lifetimes and higher reliability, bringing them closer to commercial viability.

### 5. Idea Title: Simulating Lithium Dendrite Nucleation and Growth Through Grain Boundaries
- **Rationale:** Lithium dendrites can propagate through solid electrolytes, causing short circuits. Grain boundaries are suspected to be fast pathways for dendrite growth, but the exact mechanism is debated.
- **Feasibility:** High. Phase-field modeling is well-suited to simulate dendrite growth at the mesoscale. These models can be parameterized with DFT-calculated properties of grain boundaries (e.g., Li diffusion barriers, mechanical strength) to provide a more physically accurate simulation. The challenge is obtaining accurate grain boundary structures and properties.
- **Potential Impact:** This work would elucidate the fundamental role of microstructure in dendrite formation, guiding the synthesis of electrolytes with grain boundaries engineered to resist dendrite penetration.
