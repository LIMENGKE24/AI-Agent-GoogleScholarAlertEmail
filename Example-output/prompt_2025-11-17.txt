Herein, Cu- based catalysts were modulated with arylamine ligands, which induced electron delocalization from the Cu-N centre to carbon black and enhanced surface wettability. The BTA ligand with more amino groups and fewer conjugated rings promoted the 4e ORR pathway with 97.8% selectivity.

Here, we elucidate the distinct roles of H 2 O and CO 2 in governing surface chemistry and degradation pathways of LNO under controlled atmospheres. CO 2 promotes the formation of petal‐like Li 2 CO 3, whereas H 2 O generates LiOH, triggering Ni 3+ reduction and lattice distortion.

   Abstract: Revisiting Carbon Materials for Practical Sulfide‐Based Solid‐State Lithium Batteries J Han, F Yang, Q Xu, X Qin, Y Cao, L Zhao, J Xie, P Liu… - Advanced Functional …, 2025 Carbon materials are indispensable in various batteries, which also play a vital role in emerging high‐energy solid‐state lithium batteries. Sulfide‐based solid‐state batteries show the greatest promise among the different solid batteries. Nevertheless, the large number of rigid solid–solid interfaces, mechanical instability, and reaction kinetics issues pose challenges not only to the electrode materials but also to the carbon components. However, the understanding of how carbon behaves … • Cites: ‪A cost-effective all-in-one halide material for all-solid-state batteries‬ [PDF] Review on Cathode‐Electrolyte Interphase for Stabilizing Interfaces in Solid‐State Lithium Batteries X Hu, H Zheng, C Zhang, S Zhang, Y Jin, DL Peng… - Advanced Science, 2025 Solid‐state lithium batteries (SSLBs) hold great promise for improving battery safety and achieving higher energy density. Nevertheless, the matching diversity between solid‐state electrolytes (SEs) and the paired high‐voltage cathodes complicate to understand the formation and failure mechanisms of cathode‐electrolyte interphase (CEI). Furthermore, the structural degradation of cathodes and the electrochemical decomposition of SEs during cycling continuously reconfigure the CEI and alter the … • Cites: ‪A cost-effective all-in-one halide material for all-solid-state batteries‬ [PDF] Phase Diagrams Enable Solid‐State Battery Design NL Skeele, MT Agne - Advanced Materials Interfaces, 2025 Battery degradation is often framed in terms of kinetics, yet the underlying thermodynamic driving forces are equally decisive. Spatial discontinuities in chemical potential correspond to excess free energy that the system dissipates through interfacial reactions, even under open‐circuit conditions. This perspective reframes interphase formation as a consequence of chemical potential mismatches regardless of current‐driven processes.

This paper reviews their material chemistry, crystal structure, synthesis, and characterization methods, with a focus on analyzing the composition–structure–performance relationship, and explores the effects of halogen types and their mixtures on ion transport and stability … • Cites: ‪New insights into aliovalent substituted halide solid electrolytes for …‬  F Hussain, C Zhao, H Jin, S Wang, W Xia - The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters, 2025 Lithium–metal–halide (Li–M–X) compounds, featuring high Li-ion conductivity and excellent cathode compatibility, are among the most promising solid-state electrolyte (SSE) candidates for all-solid-state Li batteries (ASSLBs), which are widely regarded as next-generation energy storage systems. However, their susceptibility to reduction reactions severely limits the use of Li metal anodes in halide-based ASSLBs, constraining the achievable energy density.

Additionally, the fundamental mechanism driving this transition remains contentious due to competing theoretical interpretations.

Traditional composite strategies combining solid electrolytes and electronic conductors cause complex solid-state interfaces that hinder carrier migration.
