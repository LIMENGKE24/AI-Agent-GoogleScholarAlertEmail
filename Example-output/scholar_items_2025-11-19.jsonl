However, the severe interface side reactions caused by residual N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and the sluggish ion migration dynamic arising from the anchor effect of PVDF chains on free Li+ have impaired the high-rate cycling capacities and lifespans of SSLMBs. To conquer the challenge, we … • Cites: ‪Challenges in speeding up solid-state battery development‬ Computational frontiers in advancing inorganic solid-state electrolytes for the next-generation lithium batteries A Suvilal, AB Krishna, R Vamadevan, JS Babu - Journal of Energy Storage, 2026 Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) offer high energy density, improve battery safety and extend lifespan, making them crucial for the development of all solid-state Lithium batteries (ASSLBs). However, their widespread application is hindered by challenges such as low ionic conductivity, interfacial instability, and mechanical limitations. In recent years, computational approaches, particularly Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Molecular Dynamics (MD), have provided … • Cites: ‪Importance of thermal transport for the design of solid-state battery …‬ [PDF] Non‐Flammable Electrolytes for Safe Lithium‐, Sodium‐, and Potassium‐Ion Batteries G Zeng, Y Tian, MD Khan, KV Mejía‐Centeno, S Wang… - Electron, 2025 The widespread deployment of rechargeable lithium‐, sodium‐, and potassium‐ion batteries (PIBs) is critically constrained by safety concerns, particularly those associated with the flammability of conventional carbonate‐based electrolytes. In response, the development of non‐flammable electrolyte systems has emerged as a key strategy to mitigate thermal runaway risks and ensure the safe operation of energy storage devices. This review provided a comprehensive overview of recent … • Cites: ‪Challenges in speeding up solid-state battery development‬ [PDF] Strong Proton-Phonon Coupling Drives Fast Ion Transport in Perovskites A Rulev, N Nagasawa, H Wang, V Pomjakushin… - 2025 Conduction of protons in solids is a cooperative process propelled by phonons, with molecular details obscured by the irregular movements in the thermal bath. We show that substitution with Y forms an imaginary phonon mode, instrumental for the function as proton conductor and effectively lowering the activation barrier for proton transport. To untangle the interplay in the exemplary proton conductor BaSn0. 9Y0. 1O3, we determine its crystallographic structure with high resolution neutron … • Cites: ‪Strongly anharmonic phonons and their role in superionic diffusion …‬  W Li, G Lu, P Jiang, R Cong, T Yang - Inorganic Chemistry, 2025 Site-selective doping in structurally complex oxides remains challenging due to multiple inequivalent cation sites and distinct coordination environments. Here, we present a strategy that couples advanced structural characterization, DFT calculations, and molecular orbital analysis to achieve site-selective doping and rational band engineering in SrGa12O19, a magnetoplumbite-type oxide featuring five distinct Ga sites. High-resolution PXRD combined with DFT calculations reveal … • Cites: ‪Thinking like a chemist: intuition in thermoelectric materials‬ This message was sent by Google Scholar because you're following new citations to articles written by Wolfgang Zeier .
